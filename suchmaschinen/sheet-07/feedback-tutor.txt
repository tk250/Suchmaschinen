Exercise 1
----------
1. You're not using JSON at all but only plain text responses. This works even
   with dynamic completion but is not what we asked for ⇒ -3 Points
2. It's dynamic but you don't parse the responses at all and only dump them to
   the HTML without any formatting. That was okayish for the last sheet but it's
   just a bit too much of a cheap solution ⇒ -1 Points
3. You aren't decoding  the URL at all. A search for ä just gives the results
   for "C3A4" its hex encoding. Also without any encoding hint in the HTML or
   the headers Chromium defaults to ISO-8859-1 which means the URL gets
   encoded differently than expected. ⇒ -4 Points
4. Not implemented ⇒ -2 Points
5. Not implemented ⇒ -2 Points
