Remarks
-------
- It would have been easier if you had included the evaluate_benchmarks.py from
  sheet 02. Also maybe then it wouldn't have crashed in `read_from_file()` with
  the following error

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "evaluate_inverted_index.py", line 166, in <module>
        index.read_from_file(file_name, b=b, k=k)
      File "/home/cstudent/tk250/sheet-08/inverted_index.py", line 84, in read_from_file
        tfstar = tf * (k + 1)/(k * (1 - b + b * dl / avdl) + tf)
    TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'

Exercise 1
----------
- `preprocessing_vsm()`: Looks good
- `process_query_vsm()`: Looks okay but couldn't easily test beyong unit tests
  because it crashes in `read_from_file()` ⇒ -2 Points

Exercise 2
----------
- No results in experiences.txt (missing) or on the Wiki nothing in the code
  ⇒ -10 Points
