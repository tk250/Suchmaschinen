Exercise 1
----------
1. The data file should be passed as an argument as described in the exercise. Both
   should be changeable with `ant` environment variables ⇒ -1 Point

   Your path check correctly prevents relative path tricks like

    echo -e 'GET /../sheet-01/feedback-tutor.txt HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n' | nc localhost 8080

  but also access to subfolders. Also only preventing '/' doesn't work on
  Windows which uses '\' for paths. ⇒ 0 Points
2. Works and is even fast.
3. You're lucky I'm not actually grading the design although the alignment was
   in the exercise… ⇒ -1 Point
