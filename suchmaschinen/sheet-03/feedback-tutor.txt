Exercise 1
----------
1. Intersection algorithms:
  - This is the weirdest implementation of binary search I've ever seen but
    I think it does work. So I think that's still okay.
  - Yes I think this counts as 3 ideas
2. Evaluation:
  - You only test the `intersectBaseline()` not that and your own version as
    required by the exercise. Replacing it does work however. â‡’ -2 Points
  - You were supposed to take averages per run but I can see how this wasn't
    super clear from the sheet
