Grading
-------

Exercise 1
----------
- You are using the wrong `example.txt` (the one from the lecture not the
  exercises) which forced you to change the test cases from the TIP file. Next
  time you should ask in the forum when you think the TIP file tests don't work.
- `read_from_file()` uses the correct way of checking the last record id.
  However your check for the record list being empty could be simplified by just
  adding the record id in the part above where the initial list is created
- `intersect()` looks fine but you're missing the test case from the TIP file
  that checks for empty intersections ⇒ -1 Point
- `process_query()` looks fine

Exercise 2
----------
- No experience.txt no points ⇒ -5 Points
- Even disregarding that your progam only allows a single keyword and doesn't
  make use of `process_query()` which would have made that quite easy.

Exercise 3
----------
- The files are here and Jenkins seems happy
