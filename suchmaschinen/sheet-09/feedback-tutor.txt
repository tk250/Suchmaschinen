- Looks okay though it might make sense for you to also take a look at the

Exercise 2
----------
- In iteration 3 the second row of D is wrong. The reason is that the previous
  normalized μ_2 vector is already wrong as (0 0 2 1)^T has length sqrt(5)
  ⇒ -1 Points
- Other than that all looks good

Exercise 3
