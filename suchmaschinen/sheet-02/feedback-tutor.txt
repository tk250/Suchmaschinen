Tips
----
- Since your postings are always length 2 it would be nicer to use tuples,
  though then you always have to change the whole tuple
- Instead of your own `second()` function you could also use `itemgetter()`
  (https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.itemgetter) or
  a lambda

Exercise 1
----------
- In `read_from_file()` You're missing the k=∞ test case and the necessary change to the formula
  ⇒ -2 Points
- Otherwise `read_from_file()` looks fine
- `merge()` looks good

Exercise 2
----------
- You really can't test stuff like this on a tiny 3 line file. Instead you
  should have tested on movies.txt. ⇒ -3 Points

Exercise 3
----------
- `read_benchmark()` looks fine
- `precision_at_k()` and `average_precision()` look fine
- You're missing the `main()` function completely. In fact your old `main()`
  doesn't work anymore because `read_from_file()` is missing `k` and `b`
  ⇒ -2 Points
