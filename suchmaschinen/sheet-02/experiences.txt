I experimented with the values of k and b, but i dont know if i got the exercise
correctly as I tried them on the queries of the example.txt sheet given and none
of my value pairs 
was better than the setting with k=1.75 and b = 0.75.
As an example for k = 1.2 and b = 0.6 i got ('animated', [[1, 0.444], [2, 0.406], [4, 0.374]]) and the original is :
('animated', [[1, 0.459], [2, 0.402], [4, 0.358]]).
These results are further from each other and therefore better I think, but i couldnt find any values of k and b where the result was further apart.
